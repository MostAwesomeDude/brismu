# Sets, not Masses

This work uses sets, not masses.

Why sets? Sets are
[free](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2023/01/freedom.html) over a
universe of individuals. While they may not have the ultimate expressive
power, they are therefore an inevitable structure which can be used for logic.
The other free gadgets are vector spaces, and we leave that treatment for
future work.

Why not masses? Masses can be expressed using plural logic; see
[la guskant](https://mw.lojban.org/papri/gadri:_an_unofficial_commentary_from_a_logical_point_of_view)
for a complete foundation, including metaphysics. However, plural logic is
equiconsistent with monadic second-order logic, given a predicate for masses.
Since we treat the full semantics of second-order logic, we see a commitment
to masses as simultaneously vague and limiting. That said, there are important
use cases to address, and I propose [discursive logic](0-midju/discursive.md)
as a way to build a form of plural logic on top of standard set-theoretic
foundations. I also give the axioms for mereology, using {pagbu} as the main
predicate.
