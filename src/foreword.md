# Foreword

> A category is a deductive system. ~ Lambek, via [Encyclopedia of
> Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/category-theory/)

This book is born from notes for a basic interpretation of Lojban using
category theory. In this theory, Lojban is syntax for an allegory or
bicategory of relations, forming a fictional universe.

## Praise from Lojbanists

> "alien language" -- la gleki

> "sad...pathetic, really" -- la cadgu'a

> "no one cares about formalism" -- la xaspeljba
