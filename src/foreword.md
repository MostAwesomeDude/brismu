# Foreword

> A category is a deductive system. ~ Lambek, via [Encyclopedia of
> Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/category-theory/)

This book is born from notes for a basic interpretation of Lojban using
category theory. In this theory, Lojban is syntax for an allegory or
bicategory of relations, forming a fictional universe.

## Coverage

Of the 1343 baseline valsi recognized as selbri (1342 gismu, 1 cmavo), 161
selbri are partially defined via formal rules. All 12 baseline abstractors (NU)
are defined. Of the 8 classic articles (LE), 2 are defined.

In addition, 8 experimental selbri are defined, as well as 6 cnino selbri which
did not previously exist.

## Credits

The bulk of this work was gathered by la korvo. [la
poros](https://pcy.ulyssis.be/) fixed some typos. Many Lojbanists, particularly
la ilmen and la selpa'i, contributed valuable insights about the logical lore
of Lojbanistan. The derived rules are from a variety of sources, but *CLL* is
the main inspiration, and thus we credit its authors and editors.  A full
bibliography is upcoming.

## Praise from Lojbanists

> "alien language" -- la gleki

> "sad...pathetic, really" -- la cadgu'a

> "no one cares about formalism" -- la xaspeljba
