# Informal Lojban

Some parts of Lojban are forever unformalizable with the current structure of
la brismu. By formalizing the syntax, we embrace all of the responsibility of
parsing, and Lojban is known to be difficult to parse. Thus, we readily
concede that some valsi will not be defined in this current project.

This listing comes from the Lojban wiki article, ["magic words in
Lojban"](https://mw.lojban.org/papri/magic_words_in_Lojban).
