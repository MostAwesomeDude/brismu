# Families

## Structures

* lanzu

lanzu1 is a set, not a mass. The baseline definition of lazmi'u makes this
clear; it uses cmima. So:

    da lanzu de di => de cmima da

lanzu3 is not clear. We will explore several standard biological concepts of
family, but we are aware of the immensely polysemous and metaphorical weight
placed on "family" by English.

## Binary gender

* bersa: son
* bruna: brother
* mamta: mother
* mensi: sister
* patfu: father
* tixnu: daughter

### Other words

Perhaps fetsi and nakni can be defined in terms of taking on various binary
gender roles, since mamta/patfu need not be biological.

## Non-binary gender

* dzena: elder, ancestor
* famti: aunt/uncle
* panzi: offspring
* rirni: parent
* rorci: procreation
* tamne: cousin
* tunba: sibling

### Issues

Is rorci symmetric in x1 and x3? Can it be generalized in practice, x4, x5,
etc. for multi-parent sexual reproduction?
