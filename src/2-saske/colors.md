# Colors

Colors are described by the following class schema:

    skari1: physical objects
    skari2: colors
    skari3: photoreceptors
    skari4: physical environments
    xinmo2: skari2

A color is a ratio of red, green, and blue. Exact ratios are yet to be
decided, but there is [a good survey of
colors](https://blog.xkcd.com/2010/05/03/color-survey-results/) for future
folks to incorporate. Extensionally, colors are the sets of all physical
objects which can appear to have that color; using {blabi} as an example:

    da blabi <=> su'o de su'o di zo'u: da skari pa ka ce'u blabi kei de di

Note that as a result, {skari} implies {ckaji}, and vice versa when {ckaji2}
is a color:

    da skari de di da4 => da ckaji de

The baseline contains the following colors:

* blabi: white
* blanu: blue
* bunre: brown, tan
* cicna: cyan, turquoise, green-blue
* crino: green, verdant
* grusi: grey
* labyxu'e: rose
* narju: orange
* nukni: magenta, fuchsia, purple-red
* pelxu: yellow, gold
* xekri: black
* xunblabi: pink
* xunre: red, crimson, ruddy
* zirpu: purple, violet

The physical environments include nothing at all (blackbody radiation),
electric fields (fluorescence), temperature (incandescence), etc.
