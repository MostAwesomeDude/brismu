# Cultures

There are many cultural gismu allocated. They are extremely divisive,
partially because they aren't well-defined and partially because people have
strong political opinions as well as emotional attachments to gismu.

There's also the concept adopted by some speakers that the cultural gismu are
only usable as rafsi, which precludes a single canonical definition of the
gismu without spoiling all of the relevant rafsi. These speakers use cultural
gismu to decorate lujvo with cultural origin, a Lojbanic adaptation of a
longstanding and widespread practice in many cultures.

## Classes

There should be a class for kulnu1:

    kulnu1: cultures
    culture1: events
    culture2: observations
    kulnu2: people
    rutni1: artifacts
    rutni2: kulnu2

This defines a template for all of the cultural gismu, as well as {rutni}.

TODO: this implies xamgu1 are events! A longstanding puzzle solved!

It should include the cultural gismu. It should also be in the upcoming
"multiverse" feature, using a multiverse, because the baseline definitions
should be culturally neutral.

There could further be a class for tutra1:

    tutra1: territories
    tutra2: ???
    natmi1: nations
    natmi2: kulnu2
    jecta1: governments
    jecta2: tutra1
    gugde1: countries
    gugde2: kulnu2
    gugde3: tutra1

## Axioms

Perhaps kulnu2 => cecmu2?

What's the difference between {jecta} and {se tutra}?
