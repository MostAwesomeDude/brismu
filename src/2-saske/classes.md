# Classes of gismu

Many gismu are related to each other in the sense that they address
representatives of an open class: they all belong to a set, and there may be
additional members of the set not yet known. We will consider open classes
which are exhaustively enumerated from the baseline, but open to experimental
gismu; this allows us to confidently categorize the baseline while allowing
extension from the community.

Classes of n-ary relations are slightly more complex, and instead of a
parametric presentation, we will use a schematic presentation. A class schema
is a diagram textually represented as multiple lines of the following form:

    broda*k*: brode*l*

Asserting that every element of the *k*-th place of {broda} is an element of
the *l*-th place of {brode}:

    ro da poi fa*k* broda zo'u: fa*l* brode

Or the following form:

    broda*k*: *x*s

Asserting that there is an open class *x* which contains every element of the
*k*-th place of {broda}. Note that this second form is not formalizable, but
semantic; it indicates when an open class is primitive with regard to Lojban's
semantic space.
