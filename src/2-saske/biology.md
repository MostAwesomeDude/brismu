## Classes

    clade1: specimens
    clade2: species

    grute2: clade2

A clade is a monophyletic rooted tree; the root is known as the [most recent
common ancestor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_recent_common_ancestor).
Note that not all collections of animals or plants form clades, and also
note that [horizontal gene
transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer) does not
invalidate membership within a clade.

Some non-animal non-plants, particularly viruses and bacteria, can also form
clades.

### Issues

It's not clear whether cladistics are required relationally. In terms of
implication, {tricu} is a subrelation of {spati} but trees don't form a clade.
Also, e.g. {ckunu} is arguably a subrelation of {tricu}, depending on whether
all conifers are trees; all conifers are woody, which may suffice.

## Animals

Animal clades are nested according to the za'a diagram.

## Fungi

* clika: moss

### Issues

{kobli} refers to both lettuce (*Lactuca*, milky sweet, also asparagus and
chickory) and cabbage (*Brassica*, alkaline savory, also broccoli and many
more). This is probably a mistake; the gloss conflates them as "leafy
vegetables" despite many cultivars (asparagus, broccolini, etc.) which are not
especially leafy. Similar issues plague {guzme}.

{latna} refers to *Lotus*, *Nymphaea*, and *Nelumbo*. Probably *Nymphaea*,
because the definition emphasizes religious use within particular cultures.
This is curious because {marna} doesn't have the same places, and only refers
to *Cannabis* specifically.

Some cultures pair roses and lilies symbolically. For that reason, {lelxe} was
proposed to complement {rozgu}. I have nothing against this one, and am tempted
to include it as a nod to la lelxe.

{smela} is the sort of gismu that I want to fix while it's still experimental.
Right now it refers exclusively to the fruits of *Prunus*, rather than the
trees; it should be more flexible, like {nimre}. {plise} and {perli} are
similarly weird and possibly worth fixing. However, it might not be feasible
to fix them and instead we will need a class for fruiting plants.

What is {jbari}? Are all {guzme} also {jbari}?

It is not clear whether {gurni} refers to processed products only. Presumably
the unprocessed kernels are {tsiju} instead.
