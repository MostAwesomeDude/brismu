## Animals

Most animals are in the big za'a dataset. I guess that we should explain the difference between cladal and non-cladal classification.

### Issues

{kobli} refers to both lettuce (*Lactuca*, milky sweet, also asparagus and
chickory) and cabbage (*Brassica*, alkaline savory, also broccoli and many
more). This is probably a mistake; the gloss conflates them as "leafy
vegetables" despite many cultivars (asparagus, broccolini, etc.) which are not
especially leafy. Similar issues plague {guzme}.

{latna} refers to *Lotus*, *Nymphaea*, and *Nelumbo*. Probably *Nymphaea*,
because the definition emphasizes religious use within particular cultures.
This is curious because {marna} doesn't have the same places, and only refers
to *Cannabis* specifically.

Some cultures pair roses and lilies symbolically. For that reason, {lelxe} was
proposed to complement {rozgu}. I have nothing against this one, and am tempted
to include it as a nod to la lelxe.

{smela} is the sort of gismu that I want to fix while it's still experimental.
Right now it refers exclusively to the fruits of *Prunus*, rather than the
trees; it should be more flexible, like {nimre}. {plise} and {perli} are
similarly weird and possibly worth fixing.

What is {jbari}? Are all {guzme} also {jbari}?

It is not clear whether {gurni} refers to processed products only. Presumably
the unprocessed kernels are {tsiju} instead.
