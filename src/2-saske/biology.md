## Clades

A clade is a monophyletic rooted tree; the root is known as the [most recent
common ancestor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_recent_common_ancestor).
Note that not all collections of animals or plants form clades, and also
note that [horizontal gene
transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer) does not
invalidate membership within a clade.

Some non-animal non-plants, particularly viruses and bacteria, can also form
clades.

The following table includes PhyloCodes which have been registered at
[RegNum](https://www.phyloregnum.org/). A PhyloCode is a registered taxon
denoting a clade for international biologists.

### Issues

{kobli} refers to both lettuce (*Lactuca*, milky sweet, also asparagus and
chickory) and cabbage (*Brassica*, alkaline savory, also broccoli and many
more). This is probably a mistake; the gloss conflates them as "leafy
vegetables" despite many cultivars (asparagus, broccolini, etc.) which are not
especially leafy. Similar issues plague {guzme}.

{latna} refers to *Lotus*, *Nymphaea*, and *Nelumbo*. Probably *Nymphaea*,
because the definition emphasizes religious use within particular cultures.
This is curious because {marna} doesn't have the same places, and only refers
to *Cannabis* specifically.

Some cultures pair roses and lilies symbolically. For that reason, {lelxe} was
proposed to complement {rozgu}. I have nothing against this one, and am tempted
to include it as a nod to la lelxe.

{smela} is the sort of gismu that I want to fix while it's still experimental.
Right now it refers exclusively to the fruits of *Prunus*, rather than the
trees; it should be more flexible, like {nimre}. {plise} and {perli} are
similarly weird and possibly worth fixing. However, it might not be feasible
to fix them and instead we will need a class for fruiting plants.

What is {jbari}? Are all {guzme} also {jbari}?

It is not clear whether {gurni} refers to processed products only. Presumably
the unprocessed kernels are {tsiju} instead.

## Other Issues

What is {jmive}? The Anglophone approach is near-useless because the following
objects are all-or-nothing on {jmive}:

* Galaxies
* Stars
* Biomes
* Forests
* Lithotrophs
* Viruses

So the Anglophone approach might be to give up and say that {jmive} is
Earth-centric: life is "homeostatic arrangements of organic chemicals in
thermal non-equilibrium," quoting la korvo.

la gleki points to the Russophone approach, in particular the axioms of B. M.
Mednikov, and proposes the valsi {mednikovo} which indexes them. This approach
includes the following characteristics of life:

* Homeostasis
* Organization
* Metabolism including an anabolic and catabolic component
* Growth
* Adaptation
* Response to stimuli
* Reproduction or autocatalysis

And of non-life:

* Cessation of brain function ({co'u})
* Divergence of homeostasis
* Cessation of metabolism

la gleki gives a translation from Russian to English of Mednikov's axioms:

> "mednikovo li 5". x1 is the organism that shows repeatedly amplified changes in the body's genetic programs being subject to selection by environmental conditions (Charles Darwin axiom)

> "mednikovo li 3": x1 is the organism showing its genetic program transferred through generations having random non-directional changes (successful only in given environment) as a result of various reasons (Charles Darwin axiom)

> "mednikovo li 2": x1 is the organism that shows taking genes of its parents for forming its offspring (N.K. Koltsov axiom)

> "mednikovo li 1": x1 is the organism that shows the unity of its phenotype and the program for its construction (genotype) inherited from its ancestors  (Weissman axiom)
