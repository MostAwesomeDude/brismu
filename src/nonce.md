# Nonce valsi

Some valsi used in this work do not appear elsewhere in Lojbanistan; they were
purpose-crafted.

## Overlap and Underlap

In mereology, the concepts of overlap and underlap are built from parthood. We
could choose to use {pagbrjonlapi} and {pagbrkuclapi} for this, but instead we
introduce the shorter lujvo {jompau} (from {jo'e pagbu}) and {kuzypau} (from
{ku'a pagbu}) for brevity and ease of pronounciation. These lujvo are not
jvajvo, because they have components from JOI. They have a simplified place
structure which only uses the first two places, in line with standard formal
mereology:

    jompau: x1 and x2 underlap

    kuzypau: x1 and x2 overlap
