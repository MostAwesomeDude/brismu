# Nonce valsi

Some valsi used in this work do not appear elsewhere in Lojbanistan; they were
purpose-crafted.

## Overlap and Underlap

In mereology, the concepts of overlap and underlap are built from parthood. We
could choose to use {pagbrjonlapi} and {pagbrkuclapi} for this, but instead we
introduce the shorter lujvo {jompau} (from {jo'e pagbu}) and {kuzypau} (from
{ku'a pagbu}) for brevity and ease of pronounciation. These lujvo are not
jvajvo, because they have components from JOI. They have a simplified place
structure which only uses the first two places, in line with standard formal
mereology:

    jompau:
    x1 and x2 underlap

    kuzypau:
    x1 and x2 overlap

## Lattice of Relations

To express bicategorical relational logic, we need gismu which are similar to
{nibli} in structure. {nibli} only operates on {du'u}, though, and we would
like to operate more directly on {ka} selbri. To facilitate this, we take
-ki'i- from {ckini} and use it as a modifier, forming {ki'irni'i},
{ki'irvlina}, and {ki'irkanxe} with the following place structures:

    ki'irni'i:
    x1 (binary ka) lattice-implies x2 (binary ka)

    ki'irvlina:
    x1 (binary ka) is the lattice-join/supremum of x2 (binary ka) and x3 (binary ka)

    ki'irkanxe:
    x1 (binary ka) is the lattice-meet/infimum of x2 (binary ka) and x3 (binary ka)

These lujvo are not jvajvo, and a jvajvo approach probably isn't possible
given the baseline alone, since {du'u} are like nullary {ka} and {ka} of
different arity aren't interchangeable.
