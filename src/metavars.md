# Metavariables

## In Lojban

Lojban has metavariables for various semantic objects:

* sumti: {ko'a}, {fo'a}, etc.
* selbri: {broda}, etc.

Lojban also has quantified bound variables:

* first-order: {da}, etc.
* second-order: {bu'a}, etc.

## In Metamath

Metamath cannot substitute a grammar production without designated
metavariables. Thus, we have embraced many experimental cmavo in order to make
our logic more flexible, and restricted semantic metavariables to serve as
specific portions of syntax.

The current mapping is as follows:

* sumti: {ko'a}, etc.
* selbri: {bu'a}, etc.
* brirebla: {bo'a}, etc.
* bridi: {broda}, etc.
* numbers: {ku'i'a}, etc.
