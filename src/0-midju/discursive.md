# Discursive Logic

On top of the formal ingredients, we should imagine that most conversational
Lojban takes place in a discursive modal logic, not **Loj** or **Selb**. This
is where words like {lo} and {le} can be properly defined. Consider:

    lo mlatu ku mlatu

This bridi does not have explicit quantifiers. Whether it is true depends on
which universe of discourse we use to interpret it. For example, the empty
universe should, in some sense, *not* satisfy it, because {lo mlatu} should
refer to something *which the speaker doesn't have in mind yet* but which
still exists. The act of clarifying referents leads to argument over [the
contents of the universe of
discourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_discourse), and so deserves
its own treatment apart from mathematics and hard sciences.
