# Discursive Logic

On top of the formal ingredients, we should imagine that most conversational
Lojban takes place in a discursive modal logic, not **Loj** or **Selb**. This
is where words like {lo} and {le} can be properly defined. Consider:

    lo mlatu ku mlatu

This *bridi* does not have explicit quantifiers. Whether it is true depends on
which universe of discourse we use to interpret it. For example, the empty
universe should, in some sense, *not* satisfy it, because {lo mlatu} should
refer to something *which the speaker doesn't have in mind yet* but which
still exists. The act of clarifying referents leads to argument over [the
contents of the universe of
discourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_discourse), and so deserves
its own treatment apart from mathematics and hard sciences.

## Restrictive and non-restrictive clauses

It's not clear what the difference between {noi} and {poi} is, but it is a
discursive difference: there is no change in logical content, but something is
denoted to listeners.

## Modals

Historically assigning any semantics to {fau} is difficult; what is the
difference between this utterance:

    broda fau lo nu brode

And this utterance:

    broda .i lo nu brode ku fasnu

We cannot rely upon any open *sumtcita* to help, since {fasnu} is unary.
Perhaps there is a discursive difference; perhaps the former utterance also
implies some connection or relevance between the two *bridi*. To be clear, the
latter utterance also has an implied connection, the "story-time convention",
as manipulated with {ki}.
