# Equivalence Relations

* dunli
  * Insists that it is not simsa
  * Could be the gismu version of du, somehow
  * Could be entailed by zmadu + mleca
  * Could entail both zmadu and mleca
* mintu
  * Comes with several axioms which we can take for now
    * x du y <=> x mintu y pa ka ce'u du ce'u
  * Might generalize to equivalence relations
    * Given equiv broda, x broda y <=> x mintu y pa ka broda
* mapti
  * Still no real confidence in what's going on, mapti3 usually omitted
  * Best guess: bijection!
    * x mapti y pa ka ce'u broda ce'u <=> x broda y, also broda is a bijection
  * Suggests that lots of casual usage of mapti should actually be ckini
    * Because x mapti y z => x ckini y z
  * Similarly, la xorxes' definition of mapti implies ^^
