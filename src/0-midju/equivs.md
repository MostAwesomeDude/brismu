# Equivalence Relations

* simsa
  * Definition allows ni, usage only for ka
  * simsa3 often used in binary, but should be unary with implicit zo'e
    * Some usage of makau, to give flavor of what else could be paired there
  * x simsa y lo ka ce'u bu'a => x bu'a + y bu'a
    * Might be a full definition! This is just something that we don't have a
      term for in maths
* dunli
  * Insists that it is not simsa
  * Could be the gismu version of du, somehow
  * Could be entailed by zmadu + mleca
  * Could entail both zmadu and mleca
* mintu
  * Comes with several axioms which we can take for now
    * x mintu y z <=> y mintu x z
    * x du y <=> x mintu y pa ka ce'u du ce'u
  * Might generalize to equivalence relations
    * Given equiv broda, x broda y <=> x mintu y pa ka broda
* mapti
  * Still no real confidence in what's going on, mapti3 usually omitted
  * Best guess: bijection!
    * x mapti y pa ka ce'u broda ce'u <=> x broda y, also broda is a bijection
  * Suggests that lots of casual usage of mapti should actually be ckini
    * Because x mapti y z => x ckini y z
