# 3: Common places

There are some places which are common to many gismu.

"Orbital parameters" are found in:

* mluni4
* plini4

"Gravity wells" (sometimes just "gravity") are found in:

* cpana3
* farlu4
* gapru3
* lafti4
* pinta2
* sraji2

"Reference frames" or "frames of reference" or "frames-of-reference" or etc.,
but *not* including gravity, are found in:

* berti3, snanu3, stuna3, stici3

"Epistemology" places are found in:

* djuno4
* jetnu2, jitfa2
* jinvi4
* zasti3
* jei2

These places seem to want selbri which each have a `{du'u}` place,
specifically:

* jijnu, with jijnu2
* smadi, with smadi2
* sruma, with sruma2
* xusra, with xusra2

These all have an x1 for the epistemic agent.

Is {milxe} like a fuzzy {ckaji}? Is {prani} a maximum of fuzzy membership?

{jbini} says that jbini3(jbini1) is within the bounds laid out by
jbini3(jbini2), and also jbini1 is in jbini2.

{ralju} says that ralju3(ralju1) is the greatest of all ralju3(ralju2), and
also that ralju1 is in ralju2.

{traji} says that traji2(traji1) is the greatest (using traji3 for comparison)
of all traji2(traji4), and also that traji1 is in traji4.

{bancu} says that bancu4(bancu1) and bancu4(bancu3) are separated by boundary
condition bancu2.

{jibni} says that jibni3(jibni1) = jibni3(jibni2) + o(e) for some small e.

{zmadu} says that zmadu3(zmadu1) = zmadu3(zmadu2) + zmadu4, more or less.

{mleca} says that mleca3(mleca1) = mleca3(mleca2) - mleca4, mirroring {zmadu}.

match as in [measurement/match]

CLL measurement gismu always have x1 with the measured object, and x2 {li}.
This rhymes with {ni}.
