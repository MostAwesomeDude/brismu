# 4: Space & Time

da rinka de => da balvi de

da balvi de <=> de purci da

aorism: are tenses aorist by default?

CLL 10.7 says VIhA series {vi'i}, {vi'a}, {vi'u}, {vi'e} correspond to
"cognitive" or "essential dimensionality", and specifically it sounds like a
generalization of manifolds and projections. A {vi'i} action is 1D, but it
occurs in 3+1D spacetime; {vi'i} indicates that the data of the action is
linear. Even curves (CLL gives walking on a mountain) can still have
low-dimensional data.

CLL 10.7 says that FAhA could be augmented with "pastward" and "futureward"
directions.

Fourth tense PU is {xa'ei}, VA is {xa'e}, SELBRI is {xlane}, all experimental.
{xlane} is symmetric like {cabna}.

{ta'e} requires agentivity. The other three can be explained in terms of the
event covering its spacetime interval.

CLL 10.23 clearly enunciates two sets of equivalent bridi families. The first
are using BAI tags:

X .i BAI bo Y <=> BAI gi Y gi X <=> X BAI le nu Y

The other, spelled out in CLL 10.16, is used for TENSE, which are PU, ZI,
FAhA, VA, or ZAhO. In all of those cases:

Y .i TENSE bo X <=> TENSE gi X gi Y <=> X TENSE le nu Y

I think that, in both cases, the final form {X do'e le nu Y} is most
primitive. This implies that {le nu} or similar is primitive.

But also, CLL 10.17 uses {.i ... bo} to glue logical connectives to BAI and
TENSE, with e.g. {.ibabo} akin to {.ijebo}. So, uh?

# Story Time

Conversationally, Lojban bridi refer to events. The story-time convention
connects those events spatiotemporally. The utterance ``{broda .i brode}``
implies something like ``{lo nu broda ku purci lo nu brode}``.
