# 1: (Lack of) Basis

Lojban has multiple possible bases in the baseline gismu. This is okay! It

both celebrate and document it.

# Exponentials & Logarithms

Both ``{tenfa}`` and ``{dugri}`` have exactly the same terbri, just in
different orders. Both relations are the same as Sanderson's Triangle of
Power; they relate a base, an exponent, and a power.

# Trigonometry

Can ``{sinso}`` be replaced with ``{tanjo}``?

# Size relations

``{barda}`` and ``{cmalu}`` are inverses.
