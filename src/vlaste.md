# Definitional vlaste

This is a *vlaste*: a dictionary of Lojban *valsi*. Unlike typical
dictionaries, which define words by evoking the associative notions of other
words, this *vlaste* only contains formal logical definitions which
[extend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_by_definitions) the underlying
basis.

Definitions are given in dependency order: a definition will only use *valsi*
which have already been introduced. For technical reasons, some transitive
dependencies are omitted from this table; a complete diagram of the
dependencies between definitions is included in [an
appendix](appendices/posets.md).

Note the following brismu conventions:

* All definitions are schematic: free metavariables are universally quantified
  and may be substituted with *any* grammatical fragments whatsoever. Bound
  metavariables are bound existentially, universally, etc. as indicated.
* The default article for {ka} and {du'u} is {pa}, not {lo}, reflecting
  *syntactic* capture rather than *semantic* capture.
* {broda} and friends refer to filled-in bridi; {bu'a} and friends refer to
  selbri, potentially including *brirebla*.
* {ku'i'a} and friends are metavariables for the PA class of *cmavo*.
