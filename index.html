<h1>Work in Progress</h1>
<p>This is the landing page for <em>brismu: a relational interpretation of
        Lojban</em>, a small book which provides logical rules for manipulating
Lojban text.</p>
<p>I am still in the process of writing the book. The first few phases are
complete; currently, the book consists of <a href="book/html/index.html">a
collection of notes for logicians and Lojbanists in English</a> and
<a href="mm/mmtheorems.html">a formally-verified collection of proofs about
        Lojban in Metamath</a>. When complete, the notes will be a proper book
which acts as an inspiration and guide for the formally-proven rules. I welcome
contributions to both collections, and give credit to proof authors.</p>
