# 2: Posetal logic

We now focus on relations which have posetal inner structure.

Suppose, for some two ``{broda}`` and ``{brode}``,

    da broda de
    -----------
    da brode de

By some rule. Then, there is an inner implication, which I'm calling the
posetal implication, from ``{broda}`` to ``{brode}``. These implications are
called "posetal" because they are structured like posets:

* Chained implications are like transitivity
* Equivalences are like antisymmetry
* Conjunction and disjunction work like in posets
* The top and bottom relations are the trivially true and false relations

This structure, interacting with the normal relational logic, is what produces
our categorical allegory structure.

# Families

A good example of a posetal family would be ``{danlu}`` and its subrelations.
