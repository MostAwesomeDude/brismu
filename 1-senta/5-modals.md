# BAI Modals

The BAI must be irregular overall; there's no single consistent pattern to
them. But perhaps there's some families of behavior.

Column deletion can't work like with normal places. Suppose we have ``{broda
bai zi'o}``; then we have no choice but to imagine it ``{broda}`` in its rows.
But does that imply that ``{broda}`` normally carries a ``{bai zo'e}`` after
it? Hopefully not! We need another part of our zo'e convention to handle this.

Compounding the difficulty, some standard places are identified using BAI. For
example, tavla4 is effectively ``{bau}``. How do we unify these places
correctly while minimizing irregularity?

I think that there can't be general semantics for ``{fi'o}``. la xorxes'
definition merely says that somehow it adjoins one selbri onto another,
without regard for the implicit unification that happens in non-trivial
examples.

# Specifying selected BAI 

## ckaji

A nice warmup to understand what we're about to do.

    ro da zo'u:

      da broda
    ------------ (kai-intro)
    broda kai da

         broda sekai da
    ======================= (sekai-intel)
    lo nu broda ku ckaji da


I am confused and frightened. I am not really enjoying this. But okay.

## ckini

Similarly,

    ro da ro de zo'u:

    da broda de
    -------------
    broda ki'i da

...Hm. I think that this is all wrong. The pattern had looked good before, but
now we're dropping data. That's no good.


## dunli

    ro da ro de zo'u:

     da broda de
    -------------
    broda du'i da

What's even going on.
