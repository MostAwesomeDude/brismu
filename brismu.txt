We interpret Lojban by building a correspondence between Lojban utterances and relations.

We start with bridi. A bridi relates a selbri to an ordered sequence, or tuple, of sumti. A bridi has a truth value within a context.

To each selbri, we assign a relation. To each bridi, we consider whether the given tuple of sumti belongs to the given selbri's relation. Recall that a relation's characteristic function tells whether a given tuple belongs to the relation; then, to each bridi, we assign a truth value that tells the underlying selbri's relation's characteristic function on the bridi's sumti.

We now assume sets and relations. To address the immediate size issues, we will forbid taking sets of all sets, or similar formulations. We will need to introduce {lo} and {lo'i} shortly, but not yet.

The first selbri we'll define is {du}. {du} corresponds to structural rules in natural deduction, but with the constraint of identity. An example rule for {du}:

da du de
========
de du da

This rule says that, given some bridi whose selbri is {du}, we may consider its sumti, which are not inspected further than to be bound to names {da} and {de}, and we may interchange {de} with {da} and vice versa. This rule is not surprising in its content, but in its structure; the double-line === instead of a single-line --- indicates that the rule is reversible and may be run backwards. In relational logic, many rules are reversible.

Our first selbri-altering word, {se}, also has reversible rules.

 da broda de
==============
de se broda da

This rule breaks the scoped interpretation, including scoped negation and scoped sumti. It corresponds to the reversibility of binary relations.

We can bind {da} multiple times in a rule, and require that the referent sumti are unified. We really do require that the referents unify to a single identity, though, as in relational logic. Thus, another rule for {du} establishes its role in identity:

da du da

This rule is an axiom! We may now state trivial theorems, like {da se du da}:

 da du da
===========
da se du da

Good warmup.
