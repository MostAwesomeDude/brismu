# -2: Ideas not yet fully cooked

{me} has poset structure according to
https://mw.lojban.org/papri/gadri:_an_unofficial_commentary_from_a_logical_point_of_view
for each of our sumti. Even better, it interoperates with {du}. {jo'u} is used
for unions; the experimental {jo'ei} could be used for intersections.

{mei} and {moi} ought to have clean interpretations once we introduce NNO
properly.

{fancu} has been a thorn in my mind for how long now? Let's say that fancu4 is
{pa ka}. We might, at first blush, require fancu4 to be functional
("single-valued"). But another route is to let fancu4 bind multiple times,
ranging over each of the possible legal functional subrelations. Like, for
each subrelation, if it's functional, then bind it.

Building on that, {da poi selcmi zo'u fancu da da pa ka ce'u du ce'u} ought to
designate the identity function on any particular set {da}. But there may be
many functional subrelations on {da} which are too small to be the identity!
In this case, though, it is okay because every element of fancu2 must be
accounted for, and so all functional subrelations satisfying this condition
will be big enough. We know, then, that there's a nice sandwich that lets {pa
ka ce'u du ce'u} do what we want here.

{mintu} is like {du} but generalized to take an equivalence relation for
mintu3.

{pamei} can justify {le} for its two sumti. So can {nomei} for its fa sumti.
Are there others?

If la tsani contributes a third insight, then they may be entitled to
co-author credit.
